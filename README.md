# Assembly Matrix Multiplication

A matrix multiplication in MASM assembly.


This has no good practical usage. Its just some old code which I did for a friend for his programming assignment. 


Some parts of the code may be useful for those who need. Like reading input from console, converting from ASCII to integer or vise versa.
